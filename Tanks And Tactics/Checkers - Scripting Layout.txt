//  NOTES:
//
//  "Modifier" is a member variable places on the object. All Modifiers have "Type" and "Value". Their "Type" determines the validity of the values you attempt to put into them.
//  "Action" is a function that can be called, and which does a certain thing. Usually these alter the values of modifiers or check for statuses of modifiers and call other actions
//  "Trigger" is a type of event that the object will listen for and it's actions determine what it will do at those triggers
//
//  Note:  Movement needs to have a check for the positions that the object can move. Perhaps an "Action" can create the list of possible positions and then when you actually move, 
//  another function would reposition the object and then go off to check for jumping and end the turn if necessary (if you can perform another jump, don't end the turn)
